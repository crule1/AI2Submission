Choosing regex for removing punctuation:
    Ran a timeit test on a simple sentence multiple times and the timing was 3 times better for regex
    when precompiled.

Spent more time making the user interface slightly friendlier than the string matching.

Choosing Counter in collections:
    This makes it faster for looking up multiple words rather than doing a count on 1 word at a time on the list.

Expanding to partial matches:
    Regex for matches?
    Prefix tree on Counter dictionary?

Testing:
    Ran on smaller files with controlled input.
    Used logging.
